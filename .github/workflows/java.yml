##
 # Reusable standardised Java workflow to automate testing, dependency patching,
 # and release publishing.
 #
 # This workflow can be called from workflows in other repos with:
 # ```
 # jobs:
 #   <job-id>:
 #     uses: brightsparklabs/github-actions/.github/workflows/java.yml@<version>
 #     secrets: inherit
 #     permissions:
 #       contents: write
 #       pull-requests: write
 # ```
